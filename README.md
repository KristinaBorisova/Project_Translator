# Project Translator
   The project contains of a simple Java app Translator that has a few functions.The task of the app is to translate successfully 
Input data from Bulgarian to English or vice versa.The main function includes translating entered input from the user, finding out
the language in which the input is written (e.g.if the entered input is a bulgarian or english word) and returning the translation  
of the word.The Translator should  also be self-tought, so when the user enters one word in the input text field and the translation 
of the same word in the output text field and clicks the "Enter Word" button , if the entered data contains of only one word, the 
word and its translation are saved directly to the database of the Translator (or so-callet .txt files with words).The program throws 
exception if we try to save more that one word in the Translators' database at ones.
