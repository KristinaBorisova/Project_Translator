# About the project 
---
  The goal of the `Tranlator Project` is to perform successful translation of an input data from Bulgarian to English or vice versa. The main functionalities include translating entered user input, finding out the language of the input (e.g.if the entered input is a bulgarian or english word) and returning the translation of the word. The program should be able to expand its database by giving the user a chance to contribute to the database (the txt files) by adding new word and its translation in both languages.
